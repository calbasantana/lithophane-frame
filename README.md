# Introduction
Over the last couple of years, I've seen a lot of lithophane projects, so I thought it was finally time to make my own. It seems like a significantly better alternative to laser engraving images and some early testing indicated better imaging quality with similar times for engraving/3D printing. I decided to create a lithophane of my amazing cat, Juno, in her halloween costume (she's a batcat).

# Material(s)
Lithophanes require a light source in order to work properly, so the following materials were purchased for this build.

Weilisi 4000mAh Video Conference Lighting,Soft Light for Video Conferencing,Zoom Light for Laptop with Clip,Stepless Dimming Computer Light for Zoom Meetings,Webcam Light with 3 Modes,Laptop Light - this can be purchased for $19.99 at the following link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09C5XKW64/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Silkland USB C 90 Degree Right Angle Adapter [2 Pack, 240W 40Gbps] USB C Male to Female Adapter Extender Compatible with Thunderbolt 4 for Steam Deck, ROG Ally, MacBook, Switch, iPhone 16/15, Quest 3 - this can be purchased for $9.99 at the following link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CNGFZ1JD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1

This project costs approximately $35, maybe $40 including taxes and other stuff.

# Lithophane & Case
This next section covers the 3D-printed case and the 3D-printed lithophane.

## Lithophane
To create the lithophane itself, I went to the following website: https://www.lithophanemaker.com/
 
I then scrolled down to "Flat Lithophane Maker." Here, I uploaded the file of my choosing, which was of my cat Juno in her halloween costume.
### Lithophane Specifications
I used the following settings:

Frame Options: Frame Only \
Crop: Yes \
Lithophane Resolution (mm/pixel): 0.2 \
Width (mm): 125 PLEASE KEEP THIS AT 125! \
Height (mm): 65 PLEASE KEEP THIS AT 65! \
Depth (mm): 7.5 \
Base Height (mm): 7.5 \
Overhang Angle (deg): 60 \
Maximum Thicknesss (mm): 3.0 \
Minimum Thickness (mm): 0.6 \
Stand Thickness (mm): 2 \
Stand Angle (degrees): 75

Once I had dialed these settings in, I clicked on "Create .stl." I extracted the file downloaded and 3D-printed it.

## Lithophane Case
For the case, I custom-designed it based on the parts. I wanted to have it on a bed headboard, so I didn't design it to tilt since it would already be about eye level for someone my height. I also wanted to make sure it was easy to keep charged, hence the decision to have the right angle adapter.

Here you can see the case from the back and how easy it is to access the USB-C port:

# Tips

The case is a little loose on the backside by default; this is so that it is easy to slide the light source in and out, but if you would like a tighter fit, you can add a few pieces of cut hardboard to the left side.

The case might look better with higher contrast, so printing it in black and the lithophane itself in white - which is better than the marble filament used here (in terms of picture quality). It might also look really awesome if the case was printed using a wood filament.

For higher quality images, when slicing your lithophane, I recommend using a lower layer height (I've made a few lithophanes with .05mm layer height and those looked amazing).
